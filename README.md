# ENEL 637-Project
# Residue Number Systems for Matrix Multiplication

**Author:** Esmaeil Shakeri  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  

This project investigates **Residue Number Systems (RNS)** for accelerating large-scale **matrix multiplication (MM)**.  
RNS enables **carry-free modular arithmetic** and parallel execution across residue channels, but it introduces a conversion bottleneck due to **WNS ↔ RNS** encoding/decoding, notably CRT-style reconstruction. The goal of this repository is to provide the **simulation code**, **generated dataset**, and **figures** for the experiment.

A brief section listing the abbreviations and their descriptions is included in the project documentation.

## What’s in this Repository

- **Code**: Python implementation for comparing WNS vs. RNS matrix multiplication timing, including conversion overhead.
- **Dataset**: Output files generated by the simulation, which include timing results used for analysis and plots.
- **Figures**: Plots created from the dataset, such as speedup vs. matrix size and component-time analysis.

## Project Summary

- Uses **k = 4** parallel residue channels.
- Example modulus set: **{127, 128, 129, 257}**.
- Total RNS time is decomposed into:
  \[
  T_{RNS} = T_{Encode} + T_{Core} + T_{Decode}.
  \]
- The experiment is designed to show when the **parallel RNS core** outweighs the **conversion overhead** as matrix size \(N\) increases.
